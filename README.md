# DSA-C
I am learning Data Structure and Algorithms using C.

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in the C programming language. 

**Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** are essential topics in computer science that enable efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. 
  
  The following data structures are implemented in this repository :-
    **Arrays**: Basic array operations and algorithms.
    **Linked Lists**: Singly linked list, doubly linked list.
    **Stacks**: Array-based stack, linked list-based stack.
    **Queues**: Array-based queue, linked list-based queue.
    **Trees**: Binary search tree (BST), AVL tree.
    **Graphs**: Graph representation (adjacency list, adjacency matrix), traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS).
